# This is my C++ Learning Journey where I post my summary of learning in github!

1) At first I learn the basic C++ structure which is basic but foundational like header( #include<iostream> ), int main(). About statement I leanrnt : to kind of remember, we can say any line that ends with semi-colon is statement (for beginner like me, it's a thumb rule). For more refer to: helloworld.cpp !

2) In second file, I initialize the variable (int) without input and added/perform basic math calculation, double, bool, string(it has different initialization technique) and character. I also used all of them in one sentence except bool (cause it throws 1 and no true/false). For more refer to: var.cpp !

3) Name spaces are used to create multiple variable of same name. For more refer to: namespace.cpp !

4) Type def is used to create a name (like nickname) for var declaration to avoid typos incase of long and inconvienent declaration. For more refer to : typeDef_typeAlias.cpp !

5) To convert variable of one data type into another, we use two method explicit and implicit, refer to : typeConversion.cpp !

6) To take input from user, we can use cin-operator that use >> unlike cout that uses <<. For more refer to userInput.cpp !

7) Using math operation is cruicial for any practical purpose. To learn more refer to mathOperator.cpp ! [These are few e.g.]

8) So, far I have covered lot of topics and I felt bore to write everything in code and repeated line in this so I wrote the needed explanation in the code.
