# This is my C++ Learning Journey where I post thing I learnt in github!

1) At first I learn the basic C++ structure which is basic but foundational like header( #include<iostream> ), int main(). About statement I leanrnt : to kind of remember, we can say any line that ends with semi-colon is statement (for beginner like me, it's a thumb rule).

2) In second file, I initialize the variable (int) without input and added/perform basic math calculation, double, bool, string(it has different initialization technique) and character. I also used all of them in one sentence except bool (cause it throws 1 and no true/false).

3) Name spaces are used to create multiple variable of same name.

4) Type def is used to create a name (like nickname) for var declaration to avoid typos incase of long and inconvienent declaration.
