# This is my C++ Learning Journey in github!

1) At first I learn the basic C++ structure which is basic but foundational like header(#include<iostream>), int main(). To kind of remember, we can say anything that ends with semi-colon is statement (for beginning it's a thumb rule).

2) In second file, I initialize the variable (int) without input and added/perform basic math calculation, double (just declaration).
