# Overview of srand and rand
1) srand(unsigned int seed):

--> This function seeds the random number generator used by rand(). The seed is a starting point for the sequence of pseudo-random numbers that rand() will generate.

By calling srand(time(NULL)), you are using the current time (in seconds since the Unix epoch) as the seed. This means that every time you run your program at a different time, the seed will likely be different, resulting in a different sequence of random numbers.


2) rand():

--> This function generates the next pseudo-random number in the sequence based on the seed set by srand().
The numbers generated by rand() are not truly random; they are deterministic and depend on the initial seed value. However, they are sufficiently random for many applications.

# <ctime>

--> This header files helps to manipulate the date and time.

"time" function gives you current time.
